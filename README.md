# xjdhdr.github.io

This repo hosts the files for my website at [https://xjdhdr.github.io/](https://xjdhdr.github.io/). Currently, I only use this website to host files for my other website where the actual web pages are hosted: [https://xjdhdr.gitlab.io/](https://xjdhdr.gitlab.io/).

I'm doing it this way because GitHub allows repos to use up to 100GB of space whereas GitLab only allows using up to 10GB.
